Every Open Source Project should contain a README file in the root folder. This file may be a markdown or plain text. The README file will contain information about the project and it should be the initial place where an user can be brief. The document may contain the following sections:

### Overview

The overview is one of the most important section in a README file. It should describe in short sentences what is the project. Any additional details should be explained in following topics. Don't satura the overview with examples or instructions. The overview may contain a header with badges to give a peak of the status of the project such as continuous integration health status, current release version, etc.

### Table of Contents (TOC)

A TOC is a helpful tool to structure the topics in the README file. The use of hyperlinks when the document is markdown is mandatory. The TOC should be show the topics indented properly.
